## Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Map Automation Script

This project provides a Python-based automation script to back out of lobbies and requeue until a specific map, such as "Stakeout," is selected during the final map selection screen in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. The script supports PC (keyboard/mouse) and controller inputs, making it versatile for different setups.
